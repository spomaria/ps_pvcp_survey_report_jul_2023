This is a Report on the Survey carried out by the Plateau State Potato Value Chain Support Project (AfDB Assisted) (PS-PVCP) to track the planting activities of Potato farmers in the State. The Survey aims to check for indicators of project development objectives as well as adoption of new technologies.

Plateau State comprises of 17 Local Government Areas (LGAs). These 17 LGAs are classified as Core Potato Producing LGAs and Non-Core Potato Producing LGAs.
The Core Potato Producing LGAs (9 in number) include: Barking Ladi, Bassa, Bokkos, Jos East, Jos North, Jos South, Mangu, Pankshin and Riyom. The Non-Core Potato Producing LGAs (8 in number) include: Kanam, Kanke, Mikang, Langtang North, Langtang South, Qua'an Pan, Shendam and Wase.

Fadama Farmers in the Non-Core Potato Producing LGAs were introduced to potato cultivation based on the fact that other areas in the Country with similar climatic conditions are into potato production.
